# chord_intersections
Given the data points on a circle. calculating the number of intersections.

## Algorithm

The algorithm essentially builds a dictionary to organize radian measures for each chord identifier and then checks for intersections by comparing each chord with all subsequent chords. The XOR operation is used to determine if the chords intersect, and the intersection count is incremented accordingly.

let's discuss the algorithm step by step

1. **Initialize the Dictionary (`chord_dict`):**
   - The algorithm starts by creating an empty dictionary called `chord_dict`. This dictionary will be used to store the radian measures for each chord identifier.

2. **Populate the Dictionary:**
   - The algorithm then iterates through the given `radian_measures` and `chord_ids` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function.
   - For each pair of radian measure (`radian`) and chord identifier (`identifier`), it extracts the unique identifier for the chord (excluding the 's' or 'e' prefix) and stores it in `chord_key`.
   - It checks if the chord identifier is already present in the dictionary (`chord_key in chord_dict`).
      - If yes, it appends the current radian measure to the list of radian measures associated with that chord identifier and sorts the list.
      - If no, it creates a new entry in the dictionary with the chord identifier as the key and a list containing the current radian measure.

3. **Initialize Intersection Counter (`intersections_count`):**
   - The algorithm initializes a counter (`intersections_count`) to keep track of the number of chord intersections.

4. **Convert Dictionary Values to List (`chord_list`):**
   - The algorithm converts the values of the dictionary (which are lists of radian measures) into a list (`chord_list`) for easier iteration.

5. **Iterate Through Chords to Check for Intersections:**
   - The algorithm uses nested loops to iterate through the list of chords (`chord_list`).
      - The outer loop (`for i, (start_1, end_1) in enumerate(chord_list)`) iterates through each chord.
      - The inner loop (`for start_2, end_2 in chord_list[i+1:]`) iterates through the remaining chords to compare them with the current chord.
      - It checks for intersections using the XOR operation.
         - If an intersection is found, it increments the intersection counter (`intersections_count`).

6. **Return the Final Count of Chord Intersections:**
   - The algorithm returns the final count of chord intersections (`intersections_count`).
